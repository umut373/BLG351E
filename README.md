| Number | Experiment Name | Description |
| :----: | :-------------- | :---------- |
| 1 | Basic Assembly Coding                      | Design a pattern to light several LEDs using GPIO ports. |
| 2 | General Purpose Input Output               | Control the lighting of an LED with a button press and display a counter showing how many times the button has been pressed. |
| 3 | Advanced Assembly Coding                   | Implement a subroutine for the modulo operation using Russian Peasant Division and create a hashmap utilizing that subroutine. |
| 4 | Stack and Subroutine                       | Develop several subroutines and functions using the stack, then merge them to form a complex program. |
| 5 | 7-Segment Display and Interrupt Subroutine | Create an even and odd counter using a 7-segment display, with the ability to switch counting modes via a button press and interrupt subroutines. |
| 6 | Playing with Time                          | Implement a timer with start-stop functionality and the ability to save the best time, using interrupt subroutines and a 7-segment display. |
| 7 | Random Number Generation                   | Develop multiple random number generator functions, display the numbers on an LCD, and store them in RAM. |
